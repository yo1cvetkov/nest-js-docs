# End To End Testing inside Nest

These files have the `e2e-spec.ts` extension.

Also for this we use the `supertest` library along with jest.

Structrue for these kind of tests is a bit different since we need to use `test` directory inside the `src` and then inside that we define directory for every module that we want to test endpoints for.

For example, if we want to test the users POST endpoint we will inside the `/test/users` create the `users.post.e2e-spec.ts` file and define the test inside that file.

While running the E2E tests we need to create a lot of fake data and for that we use the `fakerjs`.

Since we need to run the application in order to run the e2e test we need to also provide all the boostraping middlewares before we execute anything route specific.

In order to do that we need to abstract the process of attaching middlewares in bootstrap process into separate function which should accept `app` as argument of type `INestApplication`.

In the `beforeEach` block of the e2e test we need to create entire application mock.

Also, we need to create `afterEach` block which should call the `await app.close()` in order to close the app.
