# Validation and Pipes

## What are Pipes?

Besides classic approach of request response lifecycle there are bunch of steps (nodes) that one request flows through in NestJS

**Request** --- **Middleware** --- **Filters Start** --- **Guards** --- **Interceptors** --- **Pipes** --- **Controlller** --- **Interceptors** --- **Filters End** --- **Response**

This lifecycle is made to abstract different operations and modification that need to be made on the request and produce a valid response.

Also, worth mentioning is that **Error boundary** starts with the filter start and ends with the filter end. This means that in this area Nest will handle exceptions for us.

Filters doesn't happen twice, even they are displayed at the different ends of the boundary.
They happen ones while **Interceptors** happen twice (first time before the pipe and second time after the controller).

**Pipes** happen just before the request reaches the controller and there are other layers that happen before the pipes.

## Why using Pipes ?

Pipes perform two kinds of operation:

- **Validation** - They evaluate input data and if valid simply passes them through otherwise throws an exception.
- **Transformation** - Transform input data to the desired form (e.g. from string to int)

The only purpose of the pipe is that they ensure that valid data reaches the controller and if data is not valid, it throws exception.

### Types of pipes in Nest

1. Built-in - 9 out-of-the-box pipes from common package

2. Custom pipes - we can build our own custom pipes for validating and transforming incoming data.

### Built-in Pipes

**Built-in Pipes** (9 of them) - for fast integration
with params and queries validation and other simple stuff.

`ParseIntPipe` could be used to pipe the param in order to ensure that the param is integer.
Example of this:

```typescript
public getUsers(@Param('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number) {...}
```

If the input doesn't pass the pipe validation, it will automatically throw the 400 exception which then the filter exception catch.

All the pipes that start with the `Parse` will do the same but for different values.

`DefaultValuePipe` could be used to define the default value for the specific query or parameter in order to always have some value.
We can use this pipe in a slightly different way:

```typescript
public getUsers(@Param('id', ParseIntPipe) id: number, @Query('limit', new DefaultValuePipe(10), ParseIntPipe) limit?: number) {...}
```

`DefaultValuePipe` and `ValidationPipe` are the only pipes we need to use `new` keyword for.

## DTO - Introduction

For a simple values like parameters and queries it is common to use the built in pipes because they offer simple validation.

For validating a large object like request body, validation will be more complex.

For that we need to create custom pipes and for that we need DTOs.

**Data transfer object** is a class created using the `class-validator` and every time the request passes some payload data, that payload data will be validated against that DTO.

When we are creating DTOs, we use the `class-validator` package which will be responsible for defining the class of the DTO and also applying the validation rules.

First we create DTOs as a simple classes with the fields we want them to have:

```typescript
export class CreateUserDTO {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
}
```

Now to add a validation to this class we leverage the `class-validator` package like this:

```typescript
export class CreateUserDTO {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  firstName: string;

  @IsString()
  @IsOptional()
  lastName?: string;

  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  email: string;

  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  password: string;
}
```

And we can add as much validation decorators as we want.

Also we can provide custom validation message for each of them.

### Attaching DTO to the body to validate

First we need a `class-transformer` which will take this request body that endpoint receives and transforms it to the actual instance in order to validate the data against the DTO we defined.
This ensures that all the validation decorators are applied correctly considering that they are applied on the class fields.

To properly validate body against the DTO we use:

```typescript
public createUsers(@Body(new ValidationPipe()) createUserDto: CreateUserDTO) {...}
```

How does ValidationPipe knows that it needs to validate against the CreateUserDTO ?

The answer is that decorators emit the metadata and NestJS uses the special `reflect-metadata` package which carries metadata from the type annotation to the Javascript code.

This will validate the incoming body and throw exception if validation fails.

### Global pipes

It is lot of repetitive code if we need to instanciate `ValidationPipe` for each endpoint where we need to validate the body for.

Nest offers a way to define the **global** `ValidationPipe` so that we can use it inside every endpoint without repeating the same code.

In the `main.ts` file, we attach the global pipe to the app like this:

```typescript
async function bootstrap() {
  const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
  app.useGlobalPipes(
    new ValidationPipe({
      whitelist: true,
    })
  );
  await app.listen(3000);
}

bootstrap();
```

Now, we don't need to instanciate the validation pipe for each of the enpoints we just pass it the DTO class and we are good to go.

Also, if we pass the additional entries in the body, our controller will still process them which is not what we want.
Malicious client can this way send some malicious code which is bad.

The way we prevent this is using the `whitelist: true` in the configuration of the global validation pipe.

There is also a way of throwing an error if user submits some additional entry on the object. We can achieve this behavior using the `forbidNonWhitelisted: true`

_Another consideration is that actually the validated payload in not an instance of the class DTO but just the literal object. Even though we are annotating it as DTO type in the handler parameters we are not actually converting it to the instance of that DTO class._

In order to have **better type-safety** we should make it be an actual instance of the DTO class. We do that by using the `transform: true` option on the global validation pipe settings object.

### DTOs with Params and Queries

As we are able to validate the body using the DTO, we are also able to validate params and queries using also the DTO. We do that just like we did it with the body validation but instead of validating the single param, we need to validate all the params.

```typescript
@Param() getUsersParamDto: GetUsersParamDTO
```

And the DTO will look something like:

```typescript
export class GetUsersParamDTO {
  @IsOptional()
  @IsInt()
  @Type(() => Number)
  id?: number;
}
```

The `@Type` decorator is coming from `class-transformer` and it is used since all the path param values are string and our code doesn't know how to convert them so we need to tell it explicitly.

## Mapped types

In order to avoid code repetition we can use already defined DTO classes to create new DTO classes using the Mapped types.

This is another package from NestJS which allows us to either extend, omit or partialy use existing DTO classes in order to create new DTO classes.

For example, let's say we want to use the DTO class for creating some entity and re-use it for patching that same entity. We want to make all the fields on the DTO optional.

`npm install @nestjs/mapped-types`

Then:

```typescript
export class PatchUserDto extends PartialType(CreateUserDTO) {}
```

This way we created DTO that has same fields but they are all optional.
This DTO now can be used for some PATCH endpoint.
