# Documentation with NestJS

## Two kinds of documentation with NestJS

1. **API Documentation** - NestJS uses the OpenAPI (Swagger) for API documentation.
2. **Code Documentation** - NestJS uses Compodoc for Code documentation.

## OpenAPI specification

This is a formal standard for describing HTTP APIs. Basically, it is a standard that tells us how the REST API should be documented.

**Swagger** is a tool that follows the OpenAPI standard and creates the specific UI that is used for API documentation representation and overview.

## Swagger in NestJS

First we need to install it using the specific NestJS Swagger adapter `npm install @nestjs/swagger`

Inside the `main.ts` we import the swagger related stuff in order to configure Swagger.

```typescript
import { DocumentBuilder, SwaggerModule } from "@nestjs/swagger";
```

Then we need to build swagger document which we will create using the `SwaggerModule`.

```typescript
const config = new DocumentBuilder().setVersion("1.0").build();

const document = SwaggerModule.createDocument(app, config);
```

Next step is to setup the Swagger using the `SwaggerModule` on a desired path

```typescript
SwaggerModule.setup("docs", app, document);
```

This way we gave swagger our app instance, path where it should be located and the actual swagger document.

### Adding configuration to the Swagger document

In order to add more configuration to the Swagger config, we need to chain the `setTitle` method which specifies the title for the Swagger document.

The same way we can modify the description using `setDescription`. The same way we can set the license, terms of service and so on.

We can also provide the servers to our users, where they can test the API using the Swagger. For that we use the `addServer()` method that is also chained on the `DocumentBuilder` and we provide it the argument of the server from which users will be able to access the resources of the API docs.

If we want to customize different parts of the docs in order to organize it differently, we can do that on the controller itself, but also on DTOs and individual methods inside the controller. We decorate the whole controller with the `@ApiTags` followed by the name of the group we want to create for all the endpoints in that specific controller.

```typescript
@Controller('posts')
@ApiTags("Posts")
export class PostsController {...}
```

### Documenting specific endpoints

These decorators help us document all the stuff related to the specific endpoint like parameters, queries, whole endpoint and also provide responses that the user can expect from the specific endpoint.

If we have DTO for specific parameter we can document it on that place so that every time it is reused, we don't need to document it all over again.

We can document it using the `@ApiPropertyOptional` decorator which marks parameter as optional. There is also required sibling `@ApiProperty` and all of these decorators accept options object with keys like `description`. There is also `example` property and many more other properties which can say more about specific property.

Also queries are documented on the controller endpoint level like

```typescript
@ApiQuery({
  name: 'limit',
  type: 'number',
  required: false,
  default: 10,
  description: 'The number of entries returned',
  example: 10
})
public getUsers(@Query('limit') limit: number) {...}
```

If we want to summarize and explain what the specific endpoint do, we use `@ApiOperation()` followed by the configuration object that contains `summary` key that accepts string which is basically the description of what this method does.

Also we can provide the `@ApiResponse` decorator which will have the entries `status` and `description` which describes the expected responses by the endpoint. We could also specify the `example` which shows the example of the response body that will be returned to the client.

### \* _Nested DTOs_ \*

In order to validate nested objects, we need to create nested DTOs. Nested DTO is another DTO which is responsible for validating just that specific object.

The approach is to create a new DTO class. The next step is to use the `@ValidateNested` which should tell our DTO to validate the value against the nested DTO. Also we don't know what that DTO is, so we need to use `@Type` decorator for `class-transformer` and transform it to the desired DTO type in order to properly validate it.

```typescript
...
@IsOptional()
@IsArray()
@ValidateNested({ each: true})
@Type(() => CreatePostMetaOptionsDTO)
metaOptions?: CreatePostMetaOptionsDTO[]
...
```
