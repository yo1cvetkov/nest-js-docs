# Environments in NestJS

It is common that we work with multiple environments while developing the app:

- production
- development
- staging

This is possible through the `ConfigModule` provided by NestJS which we can use to determine the different variables based on the environment.

First, we need to install the config module using `npm i @nestjs/config`

Next, we need to include it inside our app, specifically inside our `AppModule`.

Then we need to include it inside the imports in the `AppModule` and with invoking the `forRoot` method which also needs the `isGlobal` flag set to `true`. If we don't set this flag, we will need to import this module in every other module in order to use it.

Other than that, we need to create the `.env` file in the root of out app. By default, our module will read from this file if not specified differently.

## Using the Config Service

If we want to access these environment variables in other modules of our app (some service for example) we need to use this config module through the constructor and using the appropriate methods access the variables.

We use it as we use other providers from DI container, just like this:

```typescript
constructor(private readonly configService: ConfigService) {}
```

In order to access some environment variable inside our service we use the `get` method on this service.

```typescript
const envVar = this.configService.get("S3_BUCKET");
```

In order to define the environment we use the usual `NODE_ENV` variable. For example in our dev script we can say that before running the script we set `NODE_ENV=development`.

Also, on the place where we import the `ConfigModule` in the very same object that forRoot accepts we define another entry with the key of `envFilePath` which accepts either string if it has one file or array of strings if it accepts more files.

_On Windows we need to say `set NODE_ENV=development && nest start --watch` in order for this to work_

Instead of using the array of environment files, we can simply use the conditional loading based on the NODE_ENV variable.
For example:

```typescript
const ENV = process.env.NODE_ENV

@Module({
  imports: [
    ...,
    ConfigModule.forRoot({
      isGlobal: true,
      envFilePath: !ENV ? '.env' : `.env.${ENV}`.trim()
    }),
    ...
  ]
})
```

This way based on environment we can have different credentials in each of the environment files.

Now, we should define our database credentials so that they use data from the `.env` file and to do that we need access to the `ConfigModule`. Also we could use the `process.env` approach, but it is recommended to always use the `ConfigService` methods whenever we could since it is more convinient and safe way.

In order to access the `ConfigService` in our `forRootAsync` factory (which is one of the reasons why we even converted it to the forRootAsync in the first place) we need to imports the `ConfigModule` inside the `imports` array of this method. After that in the `inject` array we define the `ConfigService` as the injected service.
This will inject the `ConfigService` inside the TypeOrm Factory but it is not available to the `useFactory` where we actually need it.
To access it within the `useFactory` we use the injection in the parameters of the callback as:

```typescript
...

TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  inject: [ConfigService],
  useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    ...
  })
})
```

## Custom configuration files

Custom configuration file is a file that reads from environment variables on your behalf and uses that specific file in order to assign environment variables wherever it needs to.

First, we create the global `config` folder in which we define the `app.config.js` file for example. This file should export some appConfig which returns the configuration object containing configs for database, specific environment and so on.

This config file could look something like this:

```typescript
export const appConfig = () => ({
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || "production",

  database: {
    host: process.env.DATABASE_HOST || "localhost",
    port: parseInt(process.env.DATABASE_PORT) || 5432,
    user: process.env.DATABASE_USER,
    password: process.env.DATABASE_PASSWORD,
    name: process.env.DATABASE_NAME,
    synchronize: process.env.DATABASE_SYNC === "true" ? true : false,
    autoLoadEntities: process.env.DATABASE_AUTOLOAD === "true" ? true : false,
  },
});
```

Now, how do we use this file ?

We can use this file by using the special key on the `ConfigModule` `forRoot` import where we set the `load` property to have the value of `[appConfig]`.

Now in order to use this configuration file properties we use it like this:

```typescript
TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
  imports: [ConfigModule],
  inject: [ConfigService],
  useFactory: (configService: ConfigService) => ({
    port: +configService.get("database.port"),
    username: configService.get("database.user"),
    ...
  }),
});
```

### Config files with namespaces

We can also define multiple namespaces instead of having the nested objects inside one config file or object.

In order to have different namespaces we can create separate namespace files in the `config` folder. In each of these files we define the configuration objects for specific thing. To register the namespace we use the `registerAs` function from `@nestjs/config` which will execute like this:

```typescript
export default registerAs('database', () => ({
  ...
}))
```

Now we need to tell the Nest somehow that this specific namespace exists.

Basically nothing changes, we just import these two namespaces and include it inside the load array and all the previous setting remains.

### Module configuration and Partial registration

With partial registration we are able to have module specific configuration file. This is for very large scale applications.

Anyway, we create the `config` folder inside the specific module and inside it we create a namespace for the specific configuration. Then since we want to import this configuration inside the specific module we use the `ConfigModule.forFeature` inside the imports of the specific module and pass it that specific configuration.

```typescript
imports: [
  ...,
  ConfigModule.forFeature(profileConfig),
  ...
]
```

Now, to inject it inside the specific service we use this method:

```typescript
constructor(...,
  @Inject(profileConfig.KEY)
  private readonly profileConfig: ConfigType<typeof profileConfig>
) {}
```

Also using this module configuration we also get the entire type-safety of the different environment variables.

## Validating Environment variables

For this kind of validation we should use some schema based validation library since it is not defined as some class (DTO) and it can be used before the runtime of the app to check the critical missing or not correct variables.

We should create an `env.validation.ts` file which should go inside the global `config` folder and should contain the validation for all the environment variables.

This object should look something like this:

```typescript
import * as Joi from 'joi';

export default Joi.object({
  NODE_ENV: Joi.string()
    .valid('development', 'test', 'production', 'staging')
    .default('development'),
  DATABASE_PORT: Joi.number().port().default(5432),
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: Joi.string().required(),
  DATABASE_HOST: Joi.string().required().default('localhost'),
  DATABASE_NAME: Joi.string().required(),
  DATABASE_USER: Joi.string().required(),
  ...
});
```

And this object should contain the global and also the module scoped variables we want to validate.

Now that we created this schema we can go inside our `app.module` and inside the `ConfigModule` `forRoot` we define another entry which is the `validationSchema` and pass it the value of our environment validation schema.
