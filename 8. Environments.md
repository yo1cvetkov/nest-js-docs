# Environments in NestJS

It is common that we work with multiple environments while developing the app:

- production
- development
- staging

This is possible through the `ConfigModule` provided by NestJS which we can use to determine the different variables based on the environment.

First, we need to install the config module using `npm i @nestjs/config`

Next, we need to include it inside our app, specifically inside our `AppModule`.

Then we need to include it inside the imports in the `AppModule` and with invoking the `forRoot` method which also needs the `isGlobal` flag set to `true`. If we don't set this flag, we will need to import this module in every other module in order to use it.

Other than that, we need to create the `.env` file in the root of out app. By default, our module will read from this file if not specified differently.
