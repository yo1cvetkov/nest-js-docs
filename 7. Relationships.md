## Auto-loading entities

Instead of including the entities both in the `AppModule` where we initialize the `TypeOrmModule` with the `forRootAsync` and in the single module in which entity is defined, we can go in the configuration object inside the `forRootAsync` and in the `useFactory` config object set the `autoLoadEntities: true` which will take all the entities from all the modules. This way we don't need `entities` array anymore and we pass entities to the TypeOrmModule only in the specific module.
