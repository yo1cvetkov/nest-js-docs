# Relationships

## Auto-loading entities

Instead of including the entities both in the `AppModule` where we initialize the `TypeOrmModule` with the `forRootAsync` and in the single module in which entity is defined, we can go in the configuration object inside the `forRootAsync` and in the `useFactory` config object set the `autoLoadEntities: true` which will take all the entities from all the modules. This way we don't need `entities` array anymore and we pass entities to the TypeOrmModule only in the specific module.

## OneToOne relationship

This is relationship between two entities where both entites have one and only one related entity on the other side. Uni-directional oneToOne relationship has foreign key on one entity which is the foreign key of the other entity. On the other side, when both entities know about the relationship then it is the bi-directional relationship.

To define the uni-directional one-to-one relationship we use `@OneToOne` decorator on the side where is the entity which should know about this relationship.

Required argument for this decorator is the callback function which returns connected entity.

```typescript
@OneToOne(() => MetaOption)
metaOptions?: MetaOption;
```

This is not enough, with OneToOne relationships we also need to use the `@JoinColumn` decorator which tells that we want the foreign key on this side of relationship.
