# Relationships

## Auto-loading entities

Instead of including the entities both in the `AppModule` where we initialize the `TypeOrmModule` with the `forRootAsync` and in the single module in which entity is defined, we can go in the configuration object inside the `forRootAsync` and in the `useFactory` config object set the `autoLoadEntities: true` which will take all the entities from all the modules. This way we don't need `entities` array anymore and we pass entities to the TypeOrmModule only in the specific module.

## OneToOne relationship

This is relationship between two entities where both entites have one and only one related entity on the other side. Uni-directional oneToOne relationship has foreign key on one entity which is the foreign key of the other entity. On the other side, when both entities know about the relationship then it is the bi-directional relationship.

To define the uni-directional one-to-one relationship we use `@OneToOne` decorator on the side where is the entity which should know about this relationship.

Required argument for this decorator is the callback function which returns connected entity.

```typescript
@OneToOne(() => MetaOption)
metaOptions?: MetaOption;
```

This is not enough, with OneToOne relationships we also need to use the `@JoinColumn` decorator which tells that we want the foreign key on this side of relationship.

## Cascade creation with Relationships

If we have some other entities that need to be created before creating the specific, wanted entity, we need to create first the dependent entity and then the main, desired, one.

Instead of manual creation there is an SQL native feature which is called `CASCADE` and which we can also use with TypeORM.

We can do this by going to the decorator of our foreign key, which is for example `@OneToOne` and use it like this:

```typescript
@OneToOne(() => MetaOption, {cascade: true})
@JoinColumn()
metaOptions?: MetaOption
```

This `cascade: true` will tell our database that on every operation which is happening on the entity also affect the entity with which this relation is connected. Also we can defined `cascade` option for individual operations and not for all by passing the array of string literal values instead of passing just the simple boolean value.

```typescript
@OneToOne(() => MetaOption, {cascade: ['remove', 'insert']})
@JoinColumn()
metaOptions?: MetaOption
```

### Eager loading

If we want to get something from database which has the relation to some other entity we can use first approach which is something like this:

```typescript
public async findAll() {
  const posts = await this.usersRepository.find({
    relations: {
      metaOptions: true
    }
  });

  return posts;
}
```

Or instead of doing this, we can use the **Eager loading**.

This we can do on the same place where we used the `cascade: true` but with setting `eager: true` which will now always when we fetch the specific entity also include the related entity.

## Deleting Related Entities

Cascading deleting is not possible in this case. Deleting first the meta option is not possible because of the foreign key constraint that exists. This way in the post record there will be foreign key which doesn't exist in the database.

Since we are describing still uni-directional relationship, we need to manually delete the entity and then the related entity like this:

```typescript
...
await this.postsRepository.delete(id);

await this.metaOptionsRepository.delete(post.metaOptions.id);
```

Which is bad because we need to use the repository of another module inside the service that is not related to that specific module.

_After we define the bi-directional relationship_ we will be able to delete cascading records.

## Bi-Directional OneToOne Relationships

In order to make bi-directional relationship we need to define the relation on both entities, together with the inverse relation. For example:

```typescript
@OneToOne(() => MetaOption, (metaOption) => metaOption.post, { cascade: true, eager: true})
@JoinColumn()
metaOptions?: MetaOption
```

And on the other side

```typescript
@OneToOne(() => Post, (post) => post.metaOption)
post: Post;
```

This way we created **bi-directional** relationship between two entities and now we are able to also use the cascade deletion.

### Cascade deletion with bi-directional relationship

First, if the FK is on the parent entity which we are deleting and not on the child entity which should be cascading deleted, we need to move it there since that is the entity which should be deleted when we delete parent and not the other way around.

Now that we want also the child relation to be deleted on that side in the `OneToOne` decorator, we need to define third argument which is an object containing `onDelete: 'CASCADE'`
This tells TypeORM that we also want to delete the specific related metaOptions when the post is deleted.

## OneToMany Relationships

This relationship is always bi-directional.

FK is always on the many side.

Also, we don't need to define the `@JoinColumn` since it is always on the many side.

For example, let's use common example of User and Posts

```typescript
@OneToMany(() => Post, (post) => post.author)
posts: Post[]
```

and

```typescript
@ManyToOne(() => User, (user) => user.posts)
author: User;
```

This way we created a bi-directional OneToMany (ManyToOne) relationship.

## Many To Many relationships

Since both sides can have many other relations it is not possible to hold the FK on the one of the sides. So because of that we need to have an table which is a junction table which holds the FK pairs in order to maintain relations.

Same as in One-to-one relationships, we also can have Uni or Bi directional relationships in Many-to-Many relationships.

### Uni-directional many-to-many relationship

First, we need to define the `@ManyToMany` relationship and then we need to specify which Entity it is connected to. Let's for example use Post and Tag entities:

```typescript
@ManyToMany(() => Tag)
tags?: Tag[]
```

Also, in Many-to-many relationships we need to define the `@JoinTable` decorator on the **owning side of the relation**. This will be on the post side because we will fetch the post with the tags and not the other way around.

```typescript
@ManyToMany(() => Tag)
@JoinTable()
tags?: Tag[]
```

_There is also an function from TypeOrm which looks for the specific values in an array of values and returns all of them if they are matching_

```typescript
async findMultiple(tags: number[]) {
  let results = await this.tagsRepository.find({
    where: {
      id: In(tags)
    }
  })
}
```

Also, querying for Many-to-Many relationships is the same: either we are including the specific relation in the relations object or we are setting the `eager` to `true`.

When there is an owning side of the relationship, cascades work automatically. This means that when we delete a single post the related tags will be removed but not from the tags table but from the junction table of these two entities.

### Bi-directional ManyToMany Relationships

This means that we add the `@ManyToMany` decorator on the other side of the relation. This will accept the callback which returns the `Post` entity. Besides that we need to define the other callback function where de define the inverted side of the relation. We need to define this inverted side of the relation on both entities as it was the case with `@ManyToOne` relationships.

### Cascade deletion with Many to Many relationship

In our example when we delete a post the tags still remain, but when we delete a tag it should no longer remain in any of the posts.

Just by trying to delete a single tag, we will get the error that we are violating the constraint of the FK. When we delete through the owning side of the relationship the deletion works, but the opposite way is not true.

In order to make this happen we add the configuration object on the not owning side of the relation and define the `onDelete` to `CASCADE`.

## Soft delete

For the Soft delete we will use diffent method called `softDelete` which will also accept the id. With soft delete the record won't be deleted, instead there will be a timestamp created for the deletion time. Also, soft delete won't affect the junction table.

The decision on whether we should use classic delete or soft delete depends on the requirements of the app and system.
