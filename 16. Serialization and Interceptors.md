# Serialization and Interceptors

## Interceptors

**Interceptors** in NestJS are executed twice in the request response lifecycle. One interceptor is executed between the guard and pipe and one before the Filters end, and after controller.
They are used to attach or modify something before the request reaches the controller or before the response is passed to the client.
For example, some of the tasks might be:

1. Binding extra logic before / after method execution
2. Transform result returned from the function
3. Transform the exception thrown from a function
4. Extend the basic behavior of the function
5. Completely override a function depending on specific conditions (e.g. for caching purposes)

## Entity serialization

Let's say that we created an user and that specific endpoint for user creation returns back the specific user with it's information and on that payload there is also the password and googleId present.

We want to modify that since we don't want to send back the user password hash and googleId.

For this kind of serialization, we can use interceptors. As always inside NestJS there are built in interceptors and also there is an option for the custom interceptor creation.

In order to use an interceptor, we use special decorator called `@UseInterceptors` and as an argument this decorator takes in specific interceptor that we want to apply. Also, just to mention that interceptors can be also declared globally to the entire application.

We define the specific interceptor that we use and then, in this case when we want to exclude specific properties from our response, and since we use `ClassSerializerInterceptor` we need to go to the user entity and decorate properties with the `@Exclude` to exclude them from the response. This way, `ClassSerializerInterceptor` will exclude these properties by knowing which of them have been excluded.

## Global Interceptors

For this example, we will declare an global interceptor which will bind additional data to the outgoing response and give it the apiVersion property and the actual data will be sent inside the data object.

In order to create new interceptor using the NestCLI, we use the command:

`nest g itc /common/interceptors/data-response --no-spec`

This way we create the interceptor that will transform our response. Also the NestJS gives us the boilerplate code for the interceptor:

```typescript
import { CallHandler, ExecutionContext, Injectable, NestInterceptor } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class DataResponseInterceptor implements NestInterceptor {
  intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next.handle();
  }
}
```

This interceptor implements the `NestInterceptor` interface which requires the implementation of intercept method and this method receives two arguments :

1. `context` which is of type `ExecutionContext`
2. `next` which is of type `CallHandler`

Once we are finished with the interception steps, we need to call the `next.handle()` method to call the next handler inside the app. It returns the rxJS observable which is another way of handling promises.
[Add RxJs section]

In RxJs we use the `.pipe()` method to grab the data and modify it. Inside it we can use the `tap()` method which taps into the data and modifies it.

So every code written inside the body of the `intercept` method is executed before the execution of the controller handler and everything executed inside the `next.handle()` ... is executed after the handler method is executed.

Now that we define the interceptor, we can add it as global interceptor.

```typescript
app.useGlobalInterceptors(new DataResponseInterceptor());
```

Instead of using it like this, when we need access to the other parts of our app, we need to define it inside the `app.module.ts` file and use it as an object inside the providers where we define it like this:

```typescript
{
  provide: APP_INTERCEPTOR,
  useClass: DataResponseInterceptor
}
```

Now since we want to alter our outgoing response we can inject the config service and use it to define apiVersion like this:

```typescript
...
intercept(context: ExecutionContext, next: CallHandler): Observable<any> {
    return next.handle().pipe(
      map((data) => ({
        data,
        apiVersion: this.configService.get('appConfig.apiVersion'),
      })),
    );
  }
```
