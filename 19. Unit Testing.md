# Unit Testing inside NestJs

NestJs has already an integration with Jest testing library.

In order to test functions as isolated pieces, Nest uses mocks so that we can mock dependencies and then we use them to mimic the behavior of the real dependencies.

Every unit test file inside the Nest has the `.spec.ts` extension.

Every test file starts with the `describe` block which has the description of what we are testing as the first argument and then the callback with the actual content of this test file.

The blocks inside this callback are `beforeEach` or `afterEach` or `beforeAll` or `afterAll` and so on.
There could be also other describe inside the describe and so on.

For example, inside the `beforeEach` we define the creation of Testing module and give it the controllers and providers and at the end we compile it.

Inside every describe block there is also the `it` block which specifies the feature or expected behavior more precisely.

inside it we write the assertions for each of the test cases using the `expect` function which has many other methods that we can chain.

## Creating testing module

Usually, inside the beforeEach block we need to create testing module where we should define the needed providers (services) in order to test this properly. Since we need to mock them we can use the providers object which should for `provide` key have the specific provider class and for `useValue` there should be empty object to begin with, and then we will progressively add methods in order to satisfy service needs.

In order to provide data source and repository we use slightly different approach where for the `provide` we use `DataSource` in one object and in another we use the `getRepositoryToken()` to which we pass the specific entity that we need repo for.

Then when we need to populate the speciific provider with some methods we need to define it as `Partial` type of the specific provider type and define the method that we need to test for.

When we mock repositories we can create an general type for the repository which is like:

```typescript
type MockRepository<T = any> = Partial<Record<keyof Repository<T>, jest.Mock>>;
```

Then we can create mocked repository using the generics and the function that will return mocked repo.

```typescript
const createMockRepository = <T = any>(): MockRepository<T> => ({
  findOne: jest.fn(),
  create: jest.fn(),
  save: jest.fn(),
});
```

Then we can invoke this function inside the useValue for specific provider repository. After we define it we declare it.

`usersRepository = module.get(getRepositoryToken(User));`
