# Unit Testing inside NestJs

NestJs has already an integration with Jest testing library.

In order to test functions as isolated pieces, Nest uses mocks so that we can mock dependencies and then we use them to mimic the behavior of the real dependencies.

Every unit test file inside the Nest has the `.spec.ts` extension.

Every test file starts with the `describe` block which has the description of what we are testing as the first argument and then the callback with the actual content of this test file.

The blocks inside this callback are `beforeEach` or `afterEach` or `beforeAll` or `afterAll` and so on.
There could be also other describe inside the describe and so on.

For example, inside the `beforeEach` we define the creation of Testing module and give it the controllers and providers and at the end we compile it.
