# Authentication in NestJS

The most basic types of Authentication are Password based and 0Auth (Google in this case) authentication.

Classic authentication flow goes into three steps:

1. **User registration** - user registers and its passoword is hashed and salted and user is saved to the database
2. **User logging in** - user logs in using the email and password and the password that is entered is compared to the hashed and salted password inside the database, if they match user receives issued JWT token which can be stored in different ways
3. **Accessing authorized routes** - When user tries to access authorized route JWT gets verified and if the JWT is valid request gets processed.
4. _(Optional)_ **JWT has expired** - using the refresh token user refreshes the JWT access token and gets newly issued JWT. On the other hand if this is not the case user needs to be logged in again in order to issue a new JWT.

## Hashing and salting passwords

Passwords are not saved as just hashed passwords but instead they also have the part that is called salt and in that way it is not prone to the rainbow table attacks.

### Hashing providers

We generate inside the `auth` module two providers - hashing one and bcrypt one.

This way we can make the hashing provider abstract class which should be implemented by different library specific providers like `bcrypt` or `argon2` and that will mean thatr later if we decide to use another hashing library we just make provider which implements this hashing one.

_Providing abstract classes is not possible as usual in NestJS and we need to approach differently. We need to define that when someone wants to use the specific abstract class provider it gets different (implementation) class_

For example:

```typescript
@Module({
  controllers: [...],
  providers: [
    ...,
    {
      provide: HashingProvider, // this is an abstract class
      useClass: BcryptProvider
    },
    ...
  ]
})
```

## JWT

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely between two parties.
JWT has 3 parts:

1. Header - the header decoded defines the algorithm used for encoding and type of the token. The default algorithm is HS256
2. Payload - contains information that we want to send back to the user and it is customizable. Some default properties are `sub` for example which represents the id of the user inside the database. Apart from that we can send other information and we need to remember that **payload of an JWT is accessible to everyone** so any secret or important information should not be included inside the JWT payload. Payload should ideally contain information which is sufficient to identify the user.
3. Signature - signature is created using the defined algorithm along with the url encoded values of the header and payload. After that goes the encryption key, so that it goes after the encryption of the first two components of the JWT.
   The specific key resides on the server and as long as the user don't access this key it can't recreate or decode the same JWT token.

## JWT Configuration inside NestJS

In order to use JWT we need a Nest package for JWT:

`npm i @nestjs/jwt`

Then we should define the config for the JWT either for configService or module based.

Then inside the `auth.module.ts` we import the `ConfigModule.forFeature` and pass it the config object and also we pass it the `JwtModule` which comes from the previously installed package like this:

```typescript
...
imports: [
  ...,
  JwtModule.registerAsync(jwtConfig.asProvider())
]
```

This way we reduced the boilerplate code since this way we also used the useFactory which receives the jwtConfig as provider.

In order to use our JwtService we need to inject it inside constructor of our provider / service.

```typescript
...
constructor(private readonly jwtService: JwtService,
  @Inject(jwtConfig.KEY)
  private readonly jwtConfiguration: ConfigType<typeof jwtConfig>
) {}
...
```

Then the process is simple by just invoking the `signAsync` function which accepts a JWT Payload in a first place and all the other information at the second place. It looks something like this:

```typescript
const accessToken = await this.jwtService.signAsync(
  {
    sub: user.id,
    email: user.email,
  },
  {
    audience: this.jwtConfiguration.audience,
    issuer: this.jwtConfiguration.issuer,
    secret: this.jwtConfiguration.secret,
    expiresIn: this.jwtConfiguration.accessTokenTtl,
  }
);
```
