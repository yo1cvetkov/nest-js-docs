# File Uploads

Since now, we used the content-type of application/json but when we want to send files we need to use `multipart/form-data` type in order to properly process it.

When we send the multipart form-data NestJS provides us the interceptor called `FileInterceptor`. The role of this interceptor is to extract the file from the route handler.

When we receive this buffer with the specific file we will inside some `uploadService` upload this file to the S3 and create record in the database.

Also we will structure this infrastructure in a way that the CloudFront CDN will we before the S3 storage.

## Upload module and configuration

In order to enable upload feature to the s3 we need to of course create an S3 bucket and assign the user with policies in order to get the keys. Then we create CloudFront which we connect to that specific bucket and we are ready.

Also, in order to create `UploadModule` we need to install `aws-sdk` package and `multer` types.

After we defined all necessarry environment variables we should go to t he `main.ts` file and add the configuration there. We import the `config` from `aws-sdk` and now we can setup the sdk used for uploading the files to aws s3 bucket. Now since it needs the configService in order to access needed env variables (access key and secret access key) we need to somehow get the ConfigService.

We can do that using the `app` instance and calling the `app.get(ConfigService)`.

Now that we have access to the configService we can update the aws config like:

```typescript
config.update({
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: configService.get("appConfig.awsAccessKey") as string,
    secretAccessKey: configService.get("appConfig.awsSecretAccessKey") as string,
  },
  region: configService.get("appConfig.awsRegion"),
});
```

Now we can generate new module and controller for the upload methods and also the service which will be responsible for the logic of uploads.

We need some entity for the upload to create. Then in the controller we need to accept these files in order to pass it to the service.

In order to grab this file, we use the `FileInterceptor` which is a built in interceptor inside the Nest for the request intercepting and grabbing the file.

We use the `@UseInterceptors` decorator and pass it the `FileInterceptor` which we invoke and give it the name of the field that will be sent by the client in which the file is located. After that, in our method on the controller we used the `@UploadedFile() file: Express.Multer.File`

Now the method should look something like this:

```typescript
export class UploadsController {
  @UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor("file"))
  @Post("file")
  public uploadFile(@UploadedFile() file: Express.Multer.File) {}
}
```

Now that we have access to the file we can define services and providers which will process it and store it inside the s3 bucket.
