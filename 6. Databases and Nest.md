# Databases with Nest

Services doesn't directly talk to the Database but instead there is an extra layer between the database and service which is **ORM** (Object Relational Mapping).

### ORM (Object Relational Mapping)

ORM can be divided in two parts:

- Abstraction Layer for User methods - these methods we use to perform different operations on the database
- Query language like SQL

No need for queries for a simple stuff like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 132;
```

Could be written as:

```typescript
const user = await userRepository.findOne(id);
```

Also there is a support for much complicated queries like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE rating > 4 AND lastActive >= DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 WEEK) AND amountSpent > 1200
```

Could be written as:

```typescript
usersRepository.find({
  where: {
    rating: { gt: 4 },
    lastActive: {
      gte: () => "CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'",
    },
    amountSpent: { gt: 1200 },
  },
});
```

Another advantage of using the ORM is switching the databases without having to change the exact code of the ORM.

One disadvantage of the ORM is that we have less control over the Low Level Code. Since this can be a perfromance critical thing, ORMs lets us pass a raw query if we want.

### Connecting PostgreSQL database to the NestJS app

First we need to install `typeorm`, `@nestjs/typeorm` and `pg`. After we have these we can connect our app to the database.

Inside the `app.module.ts` in the imports array we need to include `TypeOrmModule` and execute the `forRoot` method which accepts the object with the configuration options for the Postgres.

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [...,
  TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
    type: 'postgres',
    port: 5432,
    username: 'postgres',
    password: 'postgres',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'nestjs-blog'
    entities: [],
    synchronize: true // used only in dev
  }), ...]
})
```

### Using async configuration

This kind of connection that we have established is an synchronous connection and since we want to use multiple enviroments in our app we need a way of async connection.
This way we could directly inject a configuration object into the database settings. We can read from env files.

For this we change the `forRoot` sync method with the `forRootAsync` method. Every time we use the async version we need to specify the `useFactory` key and all the settings we added in the sync version of the connection goes inside the object this useFactory callback returns:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [...,
  TypeOrmModule.forRootAsync({
   useFactory: () => ({
    type: 'postgres',
    port: 5432,
    username: 'postgres',
    password: 'postgres',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'nestjs-blog'
    entities: [],
    synchronize: true // used only in dev
   })
  }), ...]
})
```

Now, when we create the ConfigurationModule and configuration service we could inject these dependencies inside and that way support the multi-env.

Also this `forRootAsync` gives us two more options (entries): `imports` array and `inject` array.

## The Repository Pattern

**Repository Pattern** - Entities and repositories

Entity === Table ; It is a file that contains all the columns that the specific table in the database should have. They are always named as singlular.

Once we create the entity file, we are able to **inject** the repository. Creation of the repository is taken care by the TypeORM, we just need to inject it inside our service. Then we are able to talk to our database using the repository given from TypeORM and injected by us.

### Entity files

They are named as singular with .entity in the middle like: `user.entity.ts`

As always, this doesn't mean nothing to the Nest and TypeOrm but in order to tell these two that the specific class is the entity we use `@Entity` decorator.
Also column definitions are defined using the appropriate `@Column` decorator and there is also special decorators for special types of columns such as `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn`.

For example, one entity can look something like:

```typescript
@Entity()
export class User {
  @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
  id: number;

  @Column()
  firstName: string;

  @Column()
  lastName: string;

  @Column({ default: true })
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

Once we have created the entity, we need a way to interact with this table and we do that through the repository which should be injected in our service.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(
    @InjectRepository(User)
    private usersRepository: Repository<User>
  ) {}

  async findAll(): Promise<User[]> {
    await this.usersRepository.find();
  }
}
```

Also, we can pass the properties to the `@Column` decorator using the object and these properties will give more context on what TypeORM and how it should define the specific column.

This could look something like:

```typescript
@Column({
  type: 'varchar',
  length: 96,
  nullable: false
})
firstName: string
```

Also when we create specific entity, it is not enought to just create it, but we need to list it into the entities array of the `forRootAsync` `useFactory` object. Also this entity needs to be listed on the specific module it depends using the `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([])` and including the entity in that array.
