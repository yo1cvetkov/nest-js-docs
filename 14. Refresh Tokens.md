# Authentication Part 2 - Refresh tokens

With the current approach of having just the access token with short TTL is not the best since they need short TTL and we need some way of generating new access tokens without having to log in again.

Refresh tokens also, in comparison to access tokens, have longer TTL. Also, they usually have different payload, usually it is just the id of the user.
Usual flow is that client checks was access token generated and if the time passed is around the token expiration it sends the `refresh` request automatically in order to get new, valid access token.
This cycle keeps going on until refresh token expires.

## Implementation

The implementation of refresh tokens includes adding the validation inside env validation and also to the jwtConfig. Then we need to define the `RefreshTokenDTO` which should contain just the simple field for the token:

```typescript
export class RefreshTokenDTO {
  @IsJwt()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  refreshToken: string;
}
```

Then, we can create a special provider for token generation which should contain methods for working with tokens and token generation.

We use then this provider inside sign in provider and then inside the service.

After we define all of that, we create endpoint for getting new, fresh access token.
