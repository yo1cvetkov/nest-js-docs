# Google Authentication

The process of authenticating user with Google:

1. User clicks to sign in with google
2. User has been redirected to the google's website to sign in
3. User completes the login process and LoginTicket (JWT token) has been generated
4. The token is sent back to the client

We need Google Cloud project and OAuth credentials for that, specifically, we need the google client id and client secret keys.

Also we need a `google-auth-library` package
`npm install google-auth-library`

Now we need to create a separate controller for the google authentication and the service that the controller will call.

Now, since password is no longer required for creating a user, password should be nullable column inside our entity.

Also there should be another optional string column on our entity called `googleId`.

Also, now since we use the client to request from our API we need to enable CORS for our app inside the `main.ts` file.

To enable it for all the urls:

```typescript
app.enableCors();
```

## Initializing Google Auth Client

First, we need the `oauthClient` as the field on our service class which is the type of `OAuth2Client` comming from `google-auth-library`.

Now since we need this oauthClient at the time module is created, we need to leverage (implement) a special interface that NestJS provides which is called `OnModuleInit` and when we use it as `implements` of our class we need to define `onModuleInit` method where we define the code that will be executed when module is instantiated.

Inside this we can generate the oauthClient.
Our `onModuleInit` should look similar to this:

```typescript
onModuleInit() {
  const clientId = this.jwtConfiguration.googleClientId
  const clientSecret = this.jwtConfiguration.googleClientSecret

  this.oauthClient = new OAuth2Client(clientId, clientSecret)
}
```

With this in place we can create an authentication method since we have client to do that now.

## Implementation of Google Authentication Strategy

First part of the authenticate method should look something like this:

```typescript
 public async authenticate(googleTokeDto: GoogleTokenDTO) {
    const loginTicket = await this.oauthClient.verifyIdToken({
      idToken: googleTokeDto.token,
    });

    const { email, sub: googleId } = loginTicket.getPayload() as TokenPayload;

    const user = await this.usersService.findOneByGoogleId(googleId);

    if (user) {
      return await this.generateTokensProvider.generateTokens(user);
    }
  }
```

And this is the specific case in which user is found using the `googleId`.

Then we need to create methods for creating a user via the google information and for that we create a new service method which we invoke. After that we generate the tokens for that specific user.

```typescript
public async authenticate(googleTokeDto: GoogleTokenDTO) {
    try {
      const loginTicket = await this.oauthClient.verifyIdToken({
        idToken: googleTokeDto.token,
      });

      const {
        email,
        sub: googleId,
        given_name: firstName,
        family_name: lastName,
      } = loginTicket.getPayload() as TokenPayload;

      const user = await this.usersService.findOneByGoogleId(googleId);

      if (user) {
        return await this.generateTokensProvider.generateTokens(user);
      }

      const newUser = await this.usersService.createGoogleUser({
        email: email as string,
        firstName: firstName as string,
        googleId,
        lastName: lastName as string,
      });

      return await this.generateTokensProvider.generateTokens(newUser);
    } catch (error) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException(error);
    }
  }
```
