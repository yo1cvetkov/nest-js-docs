# Guards and Decorators in Nest

## Guards

**Guards** are one of the schematics of NestJS and their purpose is to approve or reject requests coming to the specific route.
When created, Guards can be used within controller classes or within controller methods.

Also Guards can be applied to the module or to the entire application.

### Guard example - AccessTokenGuard

To generate a guurad we use the `nest g gu` command and it will generate the guard file for us which contains starter code for the guard like this:

```typescript
import { CanActivate, ExecutionContext, Injectable } from "@nestjs/common";
import { Observable } from "rxjs";

@Injectable()
export class AccessTokenGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    return true;
  }
}
```

Basically, every guard needs to implement this method. This method returns boolean in some kind (like a promis, observable or simple boolean value).

Since, we want to validate the token we will need some dependencies: `jwtService` and `jwtConfig`

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AccessTokenGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(
    private readonly jwtService: JwtService,
    @Inject(jwtConfig.KEY)
    private readonly jwtConfiguration: ConfigType<typeof jwtConfig>
  ) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    return true;
  }
}
```

We also have the `ExecutionContext` provided by the `canActivate` method which allows us to get the request. This execution context has multiple methods like `switchToHttp`, `switchToRpc` and so on because it is reusable and can be used inside different kinds of contexts (API types basically whether we are working with the REST API or RPC).

In order to grab the request we use the following chain of methods:

`const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest()`

Now in order to extract the JWT from the header if it exists, we can define the `private` method for that:

```typescript
private extractJwt(request: Request): string | undefined {
  const [_, token] = request.headers.authorization?.split(' ') ?? [];

  return token;
}
```

Now after we check extract the token we can verify it using the `verifyAsync` from the `jwtService` and if token is verified, attach it on the `request.user`.

```typescript
try {
  const payload = await this.jwtService.verifyAsync(token, this.jwtConfiguration);

  request[REQUEST_USER_KEY] = payload;
} catch (error) {
  throw new UnauthorizedException("Token not valid");
}
```

This way we checked for the validity of the token and threw the error if the token is invalid.

### Appying the guard - endpoint and controller based

Now, to apply the guard to the specific endpoint of controller in this case we will need the JwtConfig together with the JwtService imported inside the module we want guard to apply for.

Next, we apply the guard for the single endpoint like this:

We use the `@UseGuards` decorator where we pass the `AccessTokenGuard` like this:

```typescript
@UseGuards(AccessTokenGuard)
@Post('create-many')
public createManyUsers(...) {
  ...
}
```

If we use this decorator before the `@Controller` decorator, we will apply it for the whole controller.

### Applying the guard - globally module or application based

The way we provide the Guard to the entire module is by passing the object to the `providers` array. This object should look something like this:

```typescript
@Module({
  ...
  providers: [
    ...,
    {
      provide: APP_GUARD,
      useClass: AccessTokenGuard
    }
  ]
})
```

This way, when we set the `provide` value to the `APP_GUARD` we protected the **whole application**. Now since this is App-wide guard we don't want it to be defined as the global guard inside the `users.module` or any other module than `app.module` so we need to import there neccessarry dependencies like jwtConfig and JwtModule and then we need to provide the app-wide guard.

This way jwtConfig doesn't need to be module scoped config anymore but we can leave it like this.

Now, since entire app is protected we will need some kind of decorator to tell the specific non-protected endpoints that they are public.

## Decorators

**Decorators** in NestJS can be created for a class, specific method of the class or the parameter of the method. Purpose of the decorator is the metadata. Metadata by definition is information that describes other data providing details about its content, purpose, structure...

There are also other special decorators like `@SetMetadata` which allows us to set some specific metadata for our execution context.

## Custom decorators

In order to create custom decorator we use the `nest g d /auth/decorators/auth --flat --no-spec`.

When we use the Nest CLI to create a decorator it always creates a class or method decorator and not the param decorator.

```typescript
export const Auth = (...args: string[]) => SetMetadata("auth", args);
```

Then we can define our desired type of arguments what we expect to receive and the key for the metadata key and values based on arguments.

For example, If we create a decorator for authentication type we create `enum` with possible options (values) and also define the constant key.

Then we apply them like this:

```typescript
export const Auth = (...authTypes: AuthType[]) => SetMetadata(AUTH_TYPE_KEY, authTypes);
```

After we applied these keys we can proceed on using the decorator.

```typescript
 @Post()
  @Auth(AuthType.None)
  public createUsers(@Body() createUserDto: CreateUserDTO) {
    return this.usersService.createUser(createUserDto);
  }
```

Now, in order to profit from this metadata, we can create another guard which should decide upon the metadata whether the route is protected or not.

This way we will encapsulate the logic both of this guard with the previously created guard and use that guard as an global APP_GUARD while the first one will just be one of the providers.

After we create a new guard we need to grab the metadata from the `@Auth` decorator and for that, we need a `Reflector` class.

We inject these dependencies as:

```typescript
export class AuthenticationGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(
    private readonly reflector: Reflector,
    private readonly accessTokenGuard: AccessTokenGuard,
  ) {}

  ...
```

After that, we define the default static field for the authentication type which is defined as:

```typescript
private static readonly defaultAuthType = AuthType.Bearer;
```

Also we want to define the map which basically maps specific guard for each `AuthType` we have. This could be created as:

```typescript
 private readonly authTypeGuardMap: Record<AuthType, CanActivate> = {
    [AuthType.Bearer]: this.accessTokenGuard,
    [AuthType.None]: {
      canActivate: () => true,
    },
  };
```

Now, in order to get all the metadata for the specific key (AUTH_TYPE_KEY) that we defined from the handlers and from the classes decorated with the decorator that sets the metadata for that key we use the `reflector` instance and on it we call `getAllAndOverride` method which accepts KEY as the first argument and array of context accessors for the different context parts like:

```typescript
const authTypes = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride(AUTH_TYPE_KEY, [context.getHandler(), context.getClass()]);
```

If there is no decorator that sets some metadata for the specific key, we use the nullish coalescing operator to set it to the default type like this:

```typescript
const authTypes = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride(AUTH_TYPE_KEY, [context.getHandler(), context.getClass()]) ?? [AuthenticationGuard.defaultAuthType];
```

Now, also to remember that we accept the array of authTypes which means that if user passes multiple values and one of them is public type we should make this route public.

We then loop over all of the guard instances and resolve the `canActivate` function and based on the returned result if any of the `canActivate` functions inside these instances return `true` we pass the user to access the route. Otherwise we throw the `UnauthorizedException`.

The final `canActivate` method will look something like this:

```typescript
async canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): Promise<boolean> {
    const authTypes: AuthType[] = this.reflector.getAllAndOverride(
      AUTH_TYPE_KEY,
      [context.getHandler(), context.getClass()],
    ) ?? [AuthenticationGuard.defaultAuthType];

    const guards = authTypes.map((type) => this.authTypeGuardMap[type]).flat();

    const error = new UnauthorizedException();

    for (const instance of guards) {
      const canActivate = await Promise.resolve(
        instance.canActivate(context),
      ).catch((error) => ({
        error,
      }));

      if (canActivate) {
        return true;
      }
    }

    throw error;
  }
```

Also the DTOs for creating Posts or other user related things should not expect from client to sent the authorId directly inside the body since now we can create an decorator which gives us the payload of the user from the token and based on this payload we can define which user is creating a post for example.

For that we can also create custom decorator, but this time it will be custom user parameter decorator.

```typescript
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from "@nestjs/common";
import { REQUEST_USER_KEY } from "../constants/auth.constants";

export const ActiveUser = createParamDecorator((data: unknown, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
  const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();

  return request[REQUEST_USER_KEY];
});
```

`data` parameter is the data user passed to the specific decorator. `ctx` parameter is just the execution context of the app where users can switch between different contexts (http, grpc, websocket)...

Now, we can say that if user passes some data inside this `data` parameter we want to return the specific key of the user payload and if not we want to return entire user.

```typescript
import { createParamDecorator, ExecutionContext } from "@nestjs/common";
import { REQUEST_USER_KEY } from "../constants/auth.constants";
import { ActiveUser as IActiveUser } from "../interfaces/active-user.interface";

export const ActiveUser = createParamDecorator((field: keyof IActiveUser | undefined, ctx: ExecutionContext) => {
  const request = ctx.switchToHttp().getRequest();

  const user: IActiveUser = request[REQUEST_USER_KEY];

  return field ? user?.[field] : user;
});
```

Where the `IActiveUser` is just the interface that defines correct fields that can be passed to this decorator.

Now, we can use it within our controller like this:

```typescript
@Post()
createPost(
  @Body() createPostDto: CreatePostDTO,
  @ActiveUser() user: IActiveUser
) {...}
```
