# Transactions

**Transaction** is one complete set of CRUD operations within a database. These operations are related to each other, so that even if one operation fails the whole transaction fails.

For example: Money transfer - _If one user transfers money to another account there will be a series of operations (queries) which need to be done. First we check the balance of the account, then we deduct money from the account and then we add that money to the second account._ These series of steps are connected to one another and there will be no point if the money is deducted from the account A and Account B for some reason can't accept these money.

**Why we use transactions ?**

- **Multiple entities** - We perform multiple CRUD operations with multiple entities in one single database connection.
- **Assured Data** - All operations on all requested entities are performed to give you a final, accurate and desired result.
- **Auto Rollback** - If transaction is not completed in totality the rest of the inserted entities are rolled back automatically.

## TypeOrm QueryRunner

When we want to perform transactions with TypeORM we use something known as **QueryRunner**. Basically, we use instance of this class to perform transactions, and what it does is that it returns a single connection from the pool of connections available for the database. Connection pool is a maximum number of consecutive database connections.

1. Creating an instance of the `QueryRunner` class
2. Calling the `connect()` method to connect to the data source.
3. Once connection is established, we use `startTransaction()` method.
4. Perform the CRUD operations inside the transaction
5. Inside the try/catch block we `commitTransaction()` and in the catch `rollbackTransaction()`
6. Finally, we `realease()` current transaction before starting the next one.

_If we for example use:_

```typescript
async createMany(createUsersDto: CreateUserDTO[]) {
  ...
}
```

Since we used DTO as an array, it will ensure the type-safety but it won't ensure validation of the data using DTO.

In order to use transaction we need to inject the data source inside our service. That is provided by TypeORM which gives us the way to injecting the Data source inside our service.
This we simply do by including this in the constructor of the service like this:

```typescript
...
constructor(
  ...
  private readonly dataSource: DataSource
) {}
```

And this `DataSource` comes from TypeORM.

Now, to create a instance of the query runner we use the following steps:

```typescript
public async createMany(createUsersDto: CreateUserDTO[]) {
  const queryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();
}
```

Now we need to connect our queryRunner to the data source.

```typescript
public async createMany(createUsersDto: CreateUserDTO[]) {
  const queryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();

  await queryRunner.connect();
}
```

Next step is that we need to start a transaction.

```typescript
public async createMany(createUsersDto: CreateUserDTO[]) {
  const queryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();

  await queryRunner.connect();

  await queryRunner.startTransaction()
}
```

Once we started this, all the following CRUD operations that we perform will be a part of this transaction.

```typescript
public async createMany(createUsersDto: CreateUserDTO[]) {

  let newUsers: User[] = [];

  const queryRunner = this.dataSource.createQueryRunner();

  await queryRunner.connect();

  await queryRunner.startTransaction()

  try {
    for(let user of createUsersDto) {
      let newUser = queryRunner.manager.create(User, user);

      let result = await queryRunner.manager.save(newUser)

      newUsers.push(result)
    }

    await queryRunner.commitTransaction();

  } catch(error) {

    await queryRunner.rollbackTransaction();

  } finally {
    await queryRunner.release()
  }
}
```

### Difference between transaction and normal CRUD operation

Why don't we use transactions for every database CRUD operation ?

- We don't actually need it.

In normal CRUD endpoints we perform just one create operation and that is all, we don't need the transaction since we have just one insertion. On the other side we have many users to create and if one fails it is hard to monitor that.

## Creating Multiple Providers

As our applications grows as service grows too. So, in order to keep the code clean and maintainable we need to separate this in multiple providers. Then we can include specific provider and use the method on it.

In order to create provider we use the CLI like this:

`nest g pr users/providers/users-create-many.provider --flat --no-spec`

Now we take the method we want to transfer to that provider and we can inject it inside our service in order to use it. This way we reduce the amount of code inside our service.

_Diggression: When we used the DTO[] type, it is not correct because it doesn't ensure the validation but just the type safety. Instead we want to use new DTO which should validate each item of the array againts specific DTO._

```typescript
export class CreateManyUsersDTO {
  @IsNotEmpty()
  @IsArray()
  @ValidateNested({ each: true })
  @Type(() => CreateUserDTO)
  users: CreateUserDTO[];
}
```
