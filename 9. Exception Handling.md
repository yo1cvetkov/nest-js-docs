# Exception Handling in NestJS

## Introduction

In order to properly handle exceptions and later debug our app, NestJS comes with built-in Exceptions that we can use.

Exceptions are thrown on the providers (service) layer.

## When to think about exceptions

- **Interacting with Database** - adding, deleting, querying or updating data can be prone to errors and this could be a good place to handle exceptions that might happen.
- **Model constraints** - for example checking unique values.
- **Querying External APIs** - when using HTTP service to query external APIs there is possibility of exceptions.

### Exception handling - model constraints

We can use this exceptions when we deal with the model constraints errors. For example, uniqueness of column value:

```typescript
public async createUser(createUserDto: CreateUserDTO) {
  let exisitingUser: User | null;

  try {
    existingUser = await this.usersRepository.findOne({
      where: {
        email: createUserDto.email
      }
    })
  } catch(error) {
    throw new RequestTimeoutException("Timeout error, please try again later.")
  }

  if(existingUser) {
    throw new BadRequestException("User with a given email already exists.")
  }

  ...
}
```

## Throwing a custom exception

In order to create `CustomException` we use the `HttpException` to throw. Inside it we define the object as the first argument which hold status, error description, fileName and linenumber and other significant information, and as the second argument it holds the number of the status. The third argument is optional and it is an object that contains data which could be significant to some logging service. For example:

```typescript
throw new HttpException(
  {
    status: HttpStatus.MOVED_PERMANENTLY,
    error: "The API endpoint does not exist",
    fileName: "users.service.ts",
    lineNumber: 88,
  },
  HttpStatus.MOVED_PERMANENTLY,
  {
    cause: new Error(),
    description: "Occured because the API endpoint was permanently moved",
  }
);
```
