# Email notifications

In this example we will use Mailtrap as SMTP server for testing the emails inside our app.

Besides this service we also need new module for mail and the service that will contain the logic for sending mails. Besides that we need to install couple of dependencies in order to use the `nodemailer` with Nest.

`npm i @nestjs-modules/mailer nodemailer ejs`

_If we want to use some module as global inside many other modules and don't want to re-import it again and again we can use the `@Global` decorator before the module we want to make global. Still we have to specify what we want to export_

Inside the module for sending mails, we need to import the mailer module we installed in ordet to use mails properly.

In order to define the module we use the following approach:

```typescript
@Global()
@Module({
  imports: [
    MailerModule.forRootAsync({
      inject: [ConfigService],
      useFactory: async (config: ConfigService) => ({
        transport: {
          host: config.get('appConfig.mailHost'),
          secure: false,
          port: 2525,
          auth: {
            user: config.get('appConfig.smtpUsername'),
            pass: config.get('appConfig.smtpPassword'),
          },
        },
        defaults: {
          from: `My Blog <no-reply@nestjs-blog.com>`,
        },

        template: {
          dir: join(__dirname, 'templates'),
          adapter: new EjsAdapter(),
        },
      }),
    }),
  ],

  ...
})
```

In order to use these emails inside our service we need to provide the `MailerService` inside our service.

On that `mailerService` we use the `sendMail` method which will accept an configuration object that needs the options like to whom we are sending the mail, from which mail and template and so much more.

This way we can send mails within our app.

Also one last thing is that in the dist folder, there will be no templates files for our email templates. We need to tell our compiler that it needs to be also included in order for our code to work properly.
To do this, we go inside our nest-cli.json file and there inside the `compilerOptions` we include the `"assets"` and we define it as :

```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "deleteOutDir": true,
    "assets": [
      {
        "include": "./mail/templates",
        "outDir": "dist/",
        "watchAssets": true
      }
    ]
  }
```
