# Modules in Nest

## Introduction

**Module** is a package that encapsulates all the files related to one particular entity inside NestJS application.

`App Module` (`app.module.ts`) is a default app module which is the main module for the entire app.

Module can contain bunch of different files but ones that are most common are:

- `users.controller.ts` - routing logic API endpoints.
- `users.service.ts` - logic related to the particular functionality (business logic)
- `user.entity.ts` - structure of the users table (entity) in a database
- `user.controller.spec.ts` - file for writing tests related to the specific layer of the app (controller in this case).

Every created module in the Nest app should be connected in some way to the main App module.

One module also can have a dependency on the other module in NestJS and that can be used using the dependency injection mechanism.

## NestJS Boostraping

`main.ts` file is a central and entry file of the Nest application and it uses the NestFactory to create and initialize the app passing it the main App module.

Also some other app related things will be performed and added here. For now it just opens the port 3000 where the app is running.

## App module

`app.module.ts` is a main module of the app.

It doesn't become module because of the naming but because of the `@Module` decorator.

Every other module that will be created in the future needs to be imported in the app module so that app can identify this module.

Inside the `src` directory we can have nested directories which is basically a convention for Nest in order to encapsulate the files for each module.

`app.controller.ts` file is a file where all the routing logic is handled.

`app.service.ts` file contains the business logic called by the controller layer.

## Creating new (custom) module

What makes module a module is a `@Module` decorator which accepts a configuration metadata object.

In order for app to recognize this module we need to wire it up with the main app module.
We do this my importing the custom module inside the app module and including it in the `imports` array of the app module.

### Creating custom module using the Nest CLI

Running the command

`nest generate module users -d` will run the command in --dry-run mode
This will show us that the users module folder will be created together with the `users.module.ts` file inside it and also it will wire up this module to the `app.module.ts` in their imports array.

## Controllers intro

### Creating custom controller manually

`users.controller.ts` is the way we name a controller and defining the actual controller, like it was in the module case, we mark the class with the `@Controller` decorator.

To define the default route for the controller, we use the default path inside the `@Controller` decorator like `@Controller("users")`.

In order to properly use controller for these kinds of requests, we need to import the UsersController inside the `controllers` array in the `@Module` decorator of the corresponding module.

### Creating controller using the CLI

`nest generate controller users -d` will execute the generation of the controller in _dry-run_ mode which will just show us which steps it will execute.

This command will create controller file in the users folder and also the spec files for that controller.

If we don't want to create spec file we can use `nest generate controller --no-spec -d`

Running this command without the `-d` flag will create the controller without the spec file and wire it with the corresponding module.

### Routing decorators

As the controllers and modules are declared using the corresponding decorators, routes are also defined using the special decorators.

`@Get` decorator before the method handler for the specific resource will tell the Nest application that this is GET endpoint which gets all the users.

Similar to the `@Get` decorator, there are also other decorators for other HTTP methods such as `@Post`, `@Put`, `@Patch` and `@Delete`.

### Params, Query and Body

If we need to define parameters for the specific route we define it inside the Route decorator like `@Get("/:id")` or if we want it to be optional `@Get("/:id?")`.

Now we can grab the value of id using the special decorator `@Param` which we use inside the route handler arguments.

```typescript
@Get("/:id")
public getUsers(@Param() params: any) {
  return "Something return"
}
```

On the similar way we can get the Query parameters using the special `@Query` decorator.

```typescript
@Get("/:id")
public getUsers(@Param() params: any, @Query query: any) {
  return "Something return"
}
```

Also, worth noting is that all the params and queries are converted into JS objects so we don't need to deal with any conversions.

Sending bodies is also a similar flow - using the `@Body` decorator followed by the parameter name we want to assign and type.

```typescript
@Post()
public createUsers(@Body() body: any) {
  return "You sent a post request to create user"
}
```

### Intercepting the request and response objects

In some cases we might need to interact with the underlying request and response express objects. This is possible in Nest also.

`@Req` and `@Res` decorators are used for this purpose and also we need the corresponding interfaces from 'express' - Request and Response

We should use this only if we want to modify request and response objects only in the way which is not possible for NestJS to do out of the box.

This breaks the flow of the common practice and also we don't get the automatic exception handling from the Nest.

### Additional Request components

Besides grabbing all the params, if we need just specific params we can use it like `@Param('id')` and then take only the parameter with the name 'id'.
The same applies to query.

There is also the `@Headers` decorator for grabbing the headers from the request.

There is also the `@Ip` decorator which prints the ip address of the client that requested the resource.

## Providers - Introduction

Modules are incomplete without the providers.

**Providers** are additional classes in a module that help you add the business logic to your module.
