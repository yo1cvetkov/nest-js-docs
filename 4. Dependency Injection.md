# Dependency Injection

## Inversion of Control - Introduction

**Dependency** is some class that other class needs in order to work properly.

Without the DI mechanism, we will simply create new instance of the class current class depends on which is not good for a number of reasons.
Reasons are not important for now, but they are related to the increased resource usage, difficult testing and so on... [give more details in the future].

With DI mechanism implemented we instantiate the dependency only once (depending on the scope of the DI container) and inject it where it is needed from that central place. There are also other modifications that we can apply to the DI container scope so that it is created per request or as a transient scope... [give more details in the future]

## Dependency Injection in NestJS

NestJs internally on the bootstrap basically creates all the instances of the classes but in the exact order in which they depend on each other. This means that first, it creates the instance of the class that most other classes depends on and then goes up to look for other class on which most classes depend.

This way it creates a graph of dependency instances and they are Singleton by default which means that these classes will only be instantiated once.

### Advantages of using DI

- Decoupling - DI helps in decoupling components and layers in an application. This way we don't couple together the class to its dependencies and vice versa.
- Ease of testing - We can mock dependencies in the test and don't need to instantiate dependencies each time
- Reusability - This means that we are creating the specific component (instance) once and then we just re-use it again and again.

**Module encapsulates everything** - everything provided to the module stays in the module unless you decide to export (share) it outside the module.

**3 steps of injection**

1. **_Declare_** - We mark something as Injectable meaning that it should be instanstiated in the DI container. Classes that have the `@Injectable` decorator are called **providers**.
2. **_Connect_** - We let the module know that the provider exists by putting the provider inside the `providers` array.
3. **_Inject_** - We let the class know that the specific dependecy is needed, by including it in the contructor of the dependent class.

## Creating a Provider (Service)

Creating a provider, service in most cases, has an important and cruical step and that is the `@Injectable()` decorator prepending.

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {...}
```

This now became a valid provider. Now we need to tell our module that it is a provider.

```typescript
@Module({
  ...,
  providers: [UsersService]
})
export class UsersModule {...}
```

This is the connect step in which we tell our module that the UsersService is provider and that it should be instantiated inside the DI container.

Finally we want to inject that dependency in order to use the methods from it.

```typescript
export class UsersController {
  constructor(private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}
}
```

This is the Inject step in which our DI knows that it needs to inject the dependency `UsersService` inside the `UsersController`.

## Types of Dependency Injections

1. Intra-Modular Dependencies --> dependency between the components of the module (we have seen this so far).
2. Inter-modular dependencies --> when two modules depend on each other but in one way.
3. Circular dependencies --> when two modules depend on each other in both ways.

### Inter-Modular dependecies

In order to establish that inter-modular connection we need to export the provider from the module we want to use it and then import that module in the module where we want to use it.

We can only export providers and nothing else.

For example, let's say we want to use the methods from `UsersService` inside the `PostsModule`.

1. We export the UsersService by adding it to the `exports` array of the `UsersModule`

2. Then we import `UsersModule` inside the `PostsModule` in the `imports` array.

3. In the constructor of the specific class where we want to inject the service we inject it as before.

### Circular Dependencies

Let's say that we apply the existing knowledge of inter-modular dependencies and try to import this way the Circular dependency. This way we will also in the imports array of the UsersModule inslude the AuthModule and in the imports array of the AuthModule include the UsersModule, but...

This will cause an error and that error has to deal with circular dependencies [add more]...

The right way is to write the imports on both sides as the `forwardRef` functions which return callback which returns the specific module, like this:

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [forwardRef(() => UsersModule)]
})
export class AuthModule {...}
```

and

```typescript
@Module({
  imports: [forwardRef(() => AuthModule)]
})
export class UsersModule {...}
```

Also on the places where we inject the providers from imported modules we structure the constructor like this:

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class UsersService {
  constructor(@Inject(forwardRef(() => AuthService))
  private readonly authService: AuthService
  ) {}

  ...
}
```

or on the other side

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {
  constructor(@Inject(forwardRef(() => UsersService)) private readonly usersService: UsersService) {}

  ...
}

```

This is the correct way of using circular dependecies in NestJS.
