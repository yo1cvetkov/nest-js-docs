# Pagination in NestJS

**Pagination** means instead of sending all of the records in the database we send them with a certain limit with a page number and other meta information. This prevents load and traffic congestion and improves experience on the client.

DTO which we should create for a pagination queries should go inside the `common` directory since it will be common for more endpoints than just this one.

_Digression: Instead of using the `@Type` decorator to convert the specific value to the another type like queries and params or DTOs we can enable the following option inside the global Validation pipe and do that for every validation check_

```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.useGlobalPipes(
  new ValidationPipe({
    whitelist: true,
    forbidNonWhitelisted: true,
    transform: true,
    transformOptions: {
      enableImplicitConversion: true,
    },
  })
);
```

What if we want to have some query types for pagination and also combine them with some endpoint specific queries. Since we can't use multiple DTOs for a queries, we need to make mapped type. For example, let's say that we have some `getPosts` endpoint which accepts both the options for pagination and posts specific queries for the start and end date. We can do that like this:

```typescript
import { PaginationQueryDto } from "src/common/pagination/pagination-query.dto";

class GetPostsBaseDTO {
  @IsDate()
  @IsOptional()
  startDate?: Date;

  @IsDate()
  @IsOptional()
  endDate?: Date;
}
```

and then to combine the two DTOs inside one we use the `IntersectionType` from `mapped-types` or `swagger` if we want to document it.

```typescript
export class GetPostsDTO extends IntersectionType(GetPostsBaseDto, PaginationQueryDto) {}
```

This way we created the DTO for our queries.

In TypeORM when we want to use the pagination we use the `take` and `skip` keys on the object passed to the `find` method. Take is basically the limit of items we want to get and `skip` defines the page = (page - 1) \* limit is the formula.

With this setting we get the amount of posts that we wanted and also the specific 'page' but we don't get the pagination info about the state of the pagination.

For this we can add the Pagination module in order to define appropriate methods and have the fully fledged and reusable pagination.

Inside the `pagination.provider.ts` file we define the `PaginationProvider` class which should be an common class that encapsulates common methods/logic in order to paginate specific queries. Now, we define the `paginateQuery` method which should be open for generic type and it will be reusable method that returns paginated results.

```typescript
export class PaginationProvider {
  public async paginateQuery<T extends ObjectLiteral>(paginationQuery: PaginationQueryDTO, repository: Repository<T>) {
    let results = await repository.find({
      take: paginationQuery.limit,
      skip: (paginationQuery.page! - 1) * paginationQuery.limit!,
    });

    return results;
  }
}
```

Then we can use this method to return paginated results for every entity we want.

Now what we want is to always return the same structure (interface) from this method and this interface should look something like this:

```typescript
export interface Paginated<T> {
  data: T[];
  meta: {
    itemsPerPage: number;
    totalItems: number;
    currentPage: number;
    totalPages: number;
  };
  links: {
    first: string;
    last: string;
    current: string;
    next: string;
    prev: string;
  };
}
```

Since links need to be generated and made up from the request url followed by the appropriate query params we need to inject the Request inside out provider.

This we do like this:

```typescript
import { REQUEST } from '@nestjs/core';
import { Request } from 'express';
...
 constructor(
    @Inject(REQUEST)
    private readonly request: Request,
  ) {}
```

Now we are able to use the whole request body and data inside our provider.

We now can define our properties desired for the paginated response and also we properly type annotate the return type of this function using the create interface.
